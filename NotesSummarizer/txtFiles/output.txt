In this article, I will be looking at fuzzy propositions, fuzzy predicates, fuzzy quantifiers, fuzzy qualifiers, fuzzy probability and fuzzy predicates, all of which can be used in conventional logic, and how they can be manipulated in fuzzy logic, as well as how they are used in fuzzy propositional logic, which is a branch of logic, that is, the study of truth and falsehood, and the construction of statements and propositions that claim the degree of truth or falseness of a statement or propositional variables, which are denoted by capital letters (4A, B, etc), and connectives, which connect the propositionalVariables and the connectives of propositional Variables, both of which are referred to as propositional connectives in Fuzzy Logic, by the author of Fuzzy Propositions, Paul is Young, in his book Fuzzy Logic: A Practical Guide, published by Oxford University Press.
